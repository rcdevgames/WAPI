# WUZAPI

<img src="static/favicon.ico" width="30"> WuzAPI is an implementation 
of [@tulir/whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) library as a 
simple RESTful API service with multiple device support and concurrent 
sessions.

Whatsmeow does not use Puppeteer on headless Chrome, nor an Android emulator. 
It talks directly to WhatsApp websocket servers, thus is quite fast and uses 
much less memory and CPU than those solutions. The drawback is that a change 
in the WhatsApp protocol could break connections and will require a library 
update.

## :warning: Warning

**Using this software violating WhatsApp ToS can get your number banned**: 
Be very careful, do not use this to send SPAM or anything like it. Use at
your own risk. If you need to develop something with commercial interest 
you should contact a WhatsApp global solution provider and sign up for the
Whatsapp Business API service instead.

## Available endpoints

* Session: connect, disconnect and logout from WhatsApp. Retrieve 
connection status. Retrieve QR code for scanning.
* Messages: send text, image, audio, document, template, video, sticker, 
location and contact messages.
* Users: check if phones have whatsapp, get user information, get user avatar, 
retrieve full contact list.
* Chat: set presence (typing/paused,recording media), mark messages as read, 
download images from messages, send reactions.
* Groups: list subscribed, get info, get invite links, change photo and name.
* Webhooks: set and get webhook that will be called whenever events/messages 
are received.

## Prerequisites

Packages:

* Go (Go Programming Language)

Optional:

* Docker (Containerization)

## Building

```
go build .
```

## Run

By default it will start a REST service in port 8080. These are the parameters
you can use to alter behaviour

* -address  : sets the IP address to bind the server to (default 0.0.0.0)
* -port  : sets the port number (default 8080)
* -logtype : format for logs, either console (default) or json
* -wadebug : enable whatsmeow debug, either INFO or DEBUG levels are suported
* -sslcertificate : SSL Certificate File
* -sslprivatekey : SSL Private Key File

Example:

```
./wuzapi -logtype json
```

## Usage

In order to open up sessions, you first need to create a user and set an
authentication token for it. You can do so by updating the SQLite _users.db_
database:

``` 
sqlite3 dbdata/users.db "insert into users ('name','token') values ('John','1234ABCD')" 
```

Once you have some users created, you can talk to the API passing the **Token**
header as a simple means of authentication. You can have several users
(different numbers), on the same server.

The daemon also serves some static web files, useful for development/testing
that you can load with your browser:

* An API swagger reference in [/api](/api) A sample web page to connect and
* scan QR codes in [/login](/login) (where you will need to pass
?token=1234ABCD)


## API reference 

API calls should be made with content type json, and parameters sent into the
request body, always passing the Token header for authenticating the request.
